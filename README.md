## Senior Project, 2018

#### _Student:_ Noelle Pablo

#### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi

### Objective

The objective of this senior project is to learn about concepts of best programming practices and version control while building an R package to host the graphing functions that accompanies the Rossman and Chance ISMA textbook.


### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository which contains the following:**

1.  An R package for the ISCAM functions.

2.  A log of hours spent on senior project, which includes date, hours, and activity summary.

3.  A one page summary of your senior project.

4.  A final report.

5.  A final presentation to the Statistics Department.


### Specific Aims

*Note: For any DataCamp class that you take, it would be helpful to take notes (and post them here), so that we can re-vist or discuss important concepts.*

**1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.  Here are some GitHub resources:**

  + https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science

  + http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/

  + http://happygitwithr.com/ 
  


**2.  Adhere to good programming practices:**

  + Write all R code according to Hadley Wickam's Style Guide: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
  
  + Learn about how to write R functions: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r 
  
  
  
**3.  Adapt the ISCAM functions (http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/files.html) to an R package.  Here are some resources:**

  +  https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide
  
  +  https://github.com/knudson1/WSDS2017/blob/master/guide/Rpackages.pdf
  
  +  https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/
  
  +  http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
  

**4.  Write a vignette that accompanies the R package to illustrate it's usage.  Resources:**

+ http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html


**5.  Identify/discuss advantages and disadvantages to maintaining R functions in workspace (as currently done) versus in an R pacakge.**
  

**6.  As much as time allows...  update ISCAM functions to adhere to good programming practices and/or utlize ggplot.  Some resources:**
